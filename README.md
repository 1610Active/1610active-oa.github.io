The Dataset Site Generator allows providers to create a subsite that contains license info and other metadata. A dataset homepage and documentation are required for providers opening their data, and the generator provides this and more. The [Dataset Site Generator](https://github.com/openactive/dataset-site-generator/wiki/) includes a template site, and complete step-by-step guides designed for non-technical users.
